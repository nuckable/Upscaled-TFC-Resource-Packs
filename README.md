# Upscaled-TFC-Resource-Packs
What it says on the tin.
I'm using 2xBRZ and 4xBRZ filters to upscale vanilla Minecraft blocks/items (because TFC+ still uses those), TFC+ as well as some of the mods that work with it.

## Versions
- Vanilla Minecraft 1.7.10
- TFC+ 0.81.3
- TFC+ Udary 0.3.01
- TFC+ Cellars Addon 1.1
- Antique Atlas 4.4.4
